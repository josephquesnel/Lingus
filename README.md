# Lingus Language Cards

Lingus Language Cards is a simple way to learn another language for english speakers using self study cards. 

## How to play

Simply start the program and test your knowledge of other languages one word at a time.
The default language is French-English and can be changed in the menu.
When you click the play button, you will have 5 seconds to guess the card before it flips over.
If you guessed correctly, click the tick button to remove the card or if you got it wrong, click the big X and it will come back later.
Your score is kept in the top right and your progress between sessions gets saved automatically.
However, if you wish to restart, you can do so in the menu.

Have fun!
